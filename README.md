# 36070N VEX High Stakes 2024-2025
We are team 36070N Green Ams Robotics team in Vietnam, and this is our code for this year's High Stakes season.

## Who we are

We are a group of twelve 10th to 11th grade students from Hanoi- Amsterdam High school for the Gifted, Doan Thi Diem High school and Viet Duc High school. Although most of us donâ€™t have relevant experience in robotic competitions in the past, with the help of our mentors from the Military Technical Academy, we are motivated to achieve the Excellence award or Top 1 Skill award, and for long-term goals, keep investing passion and effort in pursuing robot-related fields. 

## Our coding platform
To program for this year's game, we use the PROS extension in Visual Studio Code, which offers a much wider range of functions compared to VEXcode V5. We also use templates for autonomous routines, which are EZ Template and LemLib.

The repository contains two folders: one is our alliance code and driver skills, and one for the autonomous skills section. Due to its simplicity, we use EZ-Template for the Aliance and Driver Skills code. As the Autonomous Skills part requires more advanced movements, we use LemLib for it.

## Our algorithms
We use PID for most movements. For the Autonomous Skills part, we use odometry to find the robot's exact position on the field and Pure Pursuit for smooth turns.

Both libraries, EZ-Template and LemLib supports PID, but odometry is only available in LemLib.

## Our goals in this competition
Representing Hanoi-Amsterdam High School for the Gifted at the VEX High Stake competition, we work diligently to make the best robot and earn a place in VEX Worlds in Dallas either through the Excellence Award or the Skills Challenge.

However, being robotics-addicts, we also aspire to help other teams to improve their coding skills. In the process of programming for the robot, we had learned a lot from other teams' code, so we wanted to give back to the community by publicizing our code, in hope that some teams will find it helpful.

## Credits
All credit for this repository goes to the members of our team, 36070N, for their relentless efforts to make our robot better everyday.
